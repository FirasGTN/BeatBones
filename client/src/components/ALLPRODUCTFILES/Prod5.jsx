            <h2>A blast from the past.</h2>
            Street Fighter is one of the best-selling titles of all time. It
            delivers warm, fuzzy nostalgia and pure, grin-inducing action that
            rivals any video game, ever. This special edition celebrates Street
            Fighter’s 35th anniversary with the perfect blend of throwback style
            and state-of-the-art audio technology.

            <h2>Mixed martial art.</h2> We loaded this limited-edition release
            with nods to Street Fighter II’s unforgettable design. No doubt you
            recognize the gray and black pebble texture of the stand-up arcade
            cabinet, but did you spot the headband fasteners? They’re modeled
            after the original action buttons. Oh, and those low-tech ‘motion
            graphics’ on the earcups? Pure FIYA.

            <h2>Hear and be heard.</h2> With PLYR, clarity is the name of the
            game. Enhanced Sound Perception optimizes the sound to your unique
            hearing — you’ll pick up every kick, punch and roundhouse. Clear
            Voice Smart Mic uses Artificial Intelligence to isolate the
            speaker’s voice and cut out background noise. Mics in the headset as
            well as the boom mean you can communicate clearly, even with the
            boom removed.

            intuitive headset controls let you mute, adjust volume and take
            calls — it’s quicker and easier than Chun-Li’s Spinning Bird Kick.
            Advanced features like E.S.P., game/chat mix, preset and custom
            equalizers and sidetone can be controlled via Skullcandy software,
            available for desktop or mobile.
