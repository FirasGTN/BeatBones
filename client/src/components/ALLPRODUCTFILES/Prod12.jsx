            <h2>On-the-go audio.</h2>
            Meet Terrain XL — the Bluetooth speaker that makes big bass and full
            sound portable. Whether it’s a bonfire on the beach, a post-hike
            camp cooldown or the pre-game tailgate, our adventure-ready speaker
            is built to handle whatever Mother Nature dishes out. Link two
            Terrain XL speakers wirelessly to listen in full stereo, or connect
            up to 99 Skullcandy Multi-Link-enabled speakers to entertain any
            crowd from 1 to 1000.

            <h2>Worry-free wireless.</h2>
            When other speakers fall short and fail, Terrain XL is just starting
            to hit its stride. With an IPX7 waterproof rating, it can be
            submerged for up to 30 minutes and come out cranking. And with 18
            hours of play time, Terrain XL won’t end the party with an awkward
            silence.

            a full-blown block party? With a simple press of a button, Terrain
            XL can wirelessly connect with up to 99 Skullcandy
            Multi-Link-enabled speakers, so it can handle any size room and any
            number of people. Just tell your friends to bring their Skullcandy
            Terrain Mini, Terrain or Terrain XL speakers and the sound system
            will grow with the guest list.
