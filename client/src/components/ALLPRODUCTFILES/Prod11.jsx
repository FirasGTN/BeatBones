            <h2>The boombox from beyond.</h2>
            Most portable speakers leave you wishing for more. Not Barrel. This
            is a full-frequency Bluetooth speaker with beautiful, bright highs,
            rich mids and deep, punchy bass. Barrel has the audio chops to
            handle a house party on its own plus the convenience of total
            portability, water-resistant construction, Skullcandy Multi-Link and
            an LED light show.

            <h2>Worry-free wireless.</h2> Rain rolling in? No need to run and
            hide — with impact-resistant construction and an IPX5 waterproof
            rating, this speaker can take a beating. Even if you’re caught in a
            surprise shower, Barrel will come out cranking. And with 12 hours of
            play time plus Rapid Charge, Barrel won’t end the party with an
            awkward silence.
