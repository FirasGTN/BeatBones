            <h2>Crusher Bass: nothing compares.</h2> Skullcandy Crusher is the
            original, one-and-only immersive sensory bass experience. It isn’t
            just deeper, it’s adjustable bass you can actually feel. Big bass
            isn’t the whole story, though. Crusher ANC 2 features Skullcandy
            Supreme Sound with 40mm drivers that have been selected and expertly
            tuned to deliver full, rich sound for music, movies and podcasts.

            <h2>For your ears only.</h2> Everyone’s hearing is different —
            that’s why Crusher ANC 2 features Personal Sound by Mimi. By taking
            a short hearing test, you’ll create a personalized sound profile
            which the Skull-iQ App uses to tune your headphones to your unique
            hearing. You’ll pick up on details in your music that you never even
            knew were there.
