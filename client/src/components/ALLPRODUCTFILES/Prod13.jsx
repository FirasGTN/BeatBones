            <h2>Feature-heavy lightweight.</h2>
            Kilo is big, beautiful sound in a tiny, portable package. This
            weather-resistant, adventure-ready powerhouse packs big battery
            life, the latest version of Bluetooth and a wireless linking system
            that lets you sync two Kilo speakers to blast your latest playlist
            in full stereo. Kilo even features a convenient clip, so you’ll
            never forget to bring your tunes along.

            <h2>Worry-free wireless.</h2>When other speakers fall short and
            fail, Kilo is just hitting its stride. With impact-resistant
            construction and an IPX7 waterproof rating, Kilo can take a beating.
            It can even be submerged for 30 minutes and come out cranking. And
            with 24 hours of play time, Kilo packs enough punch to keep the
            party going around the clock.

            <h2>A built-in clip for better hangs.</h2>Kilo comes with a built-in
            clip, so it’s easy to carry, easy to store and easy to keep track
            of. Kilo can also be linked wirelessly to another Kilo to enjoy your
            music in full stereo. Hang it on the skatepark fence to add some
            rhythm to your railslides. When your buddy shows up with their Kilo,
            you can sync them up to turn your solo sesh into a multi-media
            event.
