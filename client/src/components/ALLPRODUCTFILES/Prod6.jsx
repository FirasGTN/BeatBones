            <h2>Let your crunch come out.</h2>
            We don’t blend in. We never hold back. We’re free to be ourselves,
            and we’ve met our match — Doritos®. Together, we’re bringing bold
            self-expression to gaming with our exclusive Doritos SLYR headset
            and Dime® 2 true wireless earbuds. They’ll probably scare off the
            boring, plain chips crowd, but that’s OK. This is a super-limited
            run and we didn’t make enough for them, anyway.

            <h2>Get lit.</h2> Our Doritos limited editions are packin’ more than
            in-your-face graphics. UV-reactive highlights come to life under
            blacklights. The look is right at home with some of the big-name
            gamers’ hottest RGB setups. That means this exclusive SLYR stands
            out from the crowd all day, then stands out even more when it’s
            game-time and the lights go low.

            <h2>On the couch or on the go.</h2>SLYR gives gamers the performance
            advantage when you’re at home base. But when you’re out and about,
            you need the total freedom of a true wireless earbud. That’s why we
            created the matching Doritos limited-edition Dime 2. Grab the bundle
            and put the finishing touch on your ultimate setup.

            mic and plush memory foam earcups provide premium performance and
            all-day comfort. Plus, you can mute and adjust volume on the fly

            It’s ready to level-up your listening experience on any of these
            platforms. And with the 3.5mm audio cable, SLYR is the definition of
            ‘plug and play.’
