            <h2>Happy 40th, dudes!</h2>
            On May 5, 1984, something awoke in the sewers beneath New York City.
            Fueled by pizza and ninjutsu, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have
            been battling the forces of evil ever since. We’re stoked to join
            them in celebrating their far-out 40th with two Skullcandy Limited
            Editions. So, grab a slice, pop in your crime-fighting playlist and
            join the shell-e-bration!

            <h2>Ooze-Infused Style.</h2> We managed to get our hands on a
            canister of TCRI Mutagen Ooze, and naturally, we poured it all over
            our premium wireless gaming headset to create this part PLYR, part
            Turtle Limited Edition. From transparent and glow-in-the-dark
            elements to turtleshell earcups and a radioactive headband, TMNT
            PLYR is literally dripping with nods to the heroes in a half shell.

            colored, interchangeable headbands. For gaming, you can match your
            headband to your style of play — red for Raph’s direct attack,
            purple for Don’s calculated strategy, orange for Mikey’s controlled
            chaos or blue if you’re ready to lead the Turtles, like Leo.

            communication of Clear Voice Smart Mic. Advanced features like
            game/chat mix, equalizer controls and sidetone can be controlled via
            Skullcandy software, available for desktop or mobile. Enhanced Sound
            Perception tunes audio to your individual hearing, so you’ll hear
            Shredder before he hears you.
