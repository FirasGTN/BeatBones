            <h2>Happy 40th, dudes!</h2>
            On May 5, 1984, something awoke in the sewers beneath New York City.
            Fueled by pizza and ninjutsu, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have
            been battling the forces of evil ever since. We’re stoked to join
            them in celebrating their far-out 40th with two Skullcandy Limited
            Editions. So, grab a slice, pop in your crime-fighting playlist and
            join the shell-e-bration!

            <h2>Ooze-Infused Style.</h2> We managed to get our hands on a
            canister of TCRI Mutagen Ooze, and naturally, we poured it all over
            our premium wireless gaming headset to create this part PLYR, part
            Turtle Limited Edition. From transparent and glow-in-the-dark
            elements to turtleshell earcups and a radioactive headband, TMNT
            PLYR is literally dripping with nods to the heroes in a half shell.
