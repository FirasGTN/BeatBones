            <h2>Mission accomplished.</h2>
            Introducing Rail, our new flagship family of earbuds with Skull-iQ
            Smart Feature Technology®. We created Rail with a simple set of
            design requirements — it had to be the best sounding, best looking,
            most comfortable, most intelligent family of earbuds ever made, and
            it had to get better with time. Welcome to the future of
            future-proof audio.

            <h2>Use your words.</h2>Rail is built with Skull-iQ, a powerful
            technology that runs innovative voice features and enables new
            upgrades via the Skull-iQ App. Hands-Free Voice Controls are
            available in multiple languages. By simply starting a prompt with
            “Hey Skullcandy…,” you can control media players, summon your
            assistant (including Alexa and iHeart), access Spotify® or even take
            a photo.

            premium drivers and ergonomically designed ear gels for a
            super-comfortable, noise-isolating fit. Personal Sound by Mimi
            fine-tunes the sound to your individual hearing, and Clear Voice
            Smart Mic uses artificial intelligence to isolate your voice and
            reduce background noise.

            <h2>Never miss a call, never lose a bud.</h2> Multipoint Pairing
            makes it possible to pair your earbuds to two devices at once, so if
            your phone rings while you’re watching a movie on your laptop, your
            connection will automatically switch so you can take the call. Rail
            also comes with Tile finding technology built-in. If an earbud is
            misplaced, you can just ‘ring’ it from the free Tile app.
