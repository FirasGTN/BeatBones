            <h2>Supreme Sound tuned to you.</h2>
            SLYR Pro uses 50mm dynamic drivers that have been selected and
            expertly tuned to deliver a super-wide frequency range and rich,
            detailed sound for games, music or media. Plus, Enhanced Sound
            Perception tunes the audio to your unique hearing — you’ll pick up
            every footstep, every distant gunshot and every audio detail.

            <h2>Communicate, coordinate, dominate.</h2> Multiplayer games
            require perfectly coordinated teamwork — communication is key. Clear
            Voice Smart Mic uses Artificial Intelligence to isolate the
            speaker’s voice and cut out background noise. Mics in the headset as
            well as the boom mean you can communicate clearly, even with the
            boom removed.

            plush memory foam ear cushions that conform to the shape of your
            head. Bring on the marathon, all-day gaming sessions — SLYR Pro is
            so comfortable you’ll forget you’re even wearing a headset.
