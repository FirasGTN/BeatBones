            <h2>Use your words.</h2>Voice Control means you never need to take
            off your gloves or let go of the handlebar. Just say ‘Hey
            Skullcandy’ to control audio, launch Spotify® and take calls. You
            can activate Alexa and other voice assistants in the Skull-iQ App.
            It’s true wireless freedom, taken to a whole new level.

            <h2>Teaching your buds new tricks.</h2> Skull-iQ = upgradability.
            We’ve already added several features since we originally released
            Grind, including voice commands for incremental volume control and
            your choice of 5 different languages. We also added Adjustable
            Stay-Aware Mode and Personal Sound, which lets you take a hearing
            test in the app to tune the sound to your unique hearing.

            <h2>Hours of power.</h2>Grind delivers a whopping 40 hours of
            listening time between the charging case and buds. Plus, your
            earbuds tell you how much battery is left every time you remove them
            from the case.
